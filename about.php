	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
	As web designers and developers we must develop an understanding of the technology and techniques
	currently deployed within the industry. Based upon this research and knowledge we should build a
	process and set of patterns that both suit our development style and the requirements of our client-
	base.
	</p>
	<p>
	While we are learning these new technologies and investigating the various techniques this gives us
	a unique scenario to try out the various methods and processes available and to initial construct a
	process that we can later further adapt.

	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
	After over 20 years of experience within the industry I have adapted a very iterative technique in
	my development process. Through this experience I find it easy to adapt and change to the requirements
	of the current project.
	</p>
	<p>
	Initially I started by using a less iterative method and created a workflow that relied on order and was
	very structured. The disadvantage of this method was more apparent when my workload shifted from design and
	development to predominantly development. The need for structure and ordered techniques was more of a barrier
	than a improver.
