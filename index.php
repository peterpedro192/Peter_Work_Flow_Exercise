							When designing and developing web sites, it is essential to ensure one develop's a process
							that ensures the efficient and effective implementation of information, style, interaction
							and business logic. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the use of such a process.

						</p>
						<p>
							Most practioners and professionals develop their own methods and techniques but the current
							industry discussion is around standardising the techniques whilst maintaining flexibility of
							process. Historically, most processes have involved the <strong>waterfall</strong> project
							management process. In more recent times, and with the increase in web based applications
							and therefore development techniques, the move has been towards more iterative project
							management techniques.

						<h3>Waterfall method</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							Sequential design and development has been the basis of the majority of software and web
							site development since its conception. The benefits of using this technique is that one
							technique or task can be focused on at one time and there is less need for multi-disciplined
							workers within the project.

						</p>
						<p>
							Specialists can focus on the tasks that perform at best. The
							disadvantages are the lack of flexibility in the timing of each task and that barriers and
							blockers can have a catistrophic impact on the outcome and deadline of the project. Strict
							milestones must be adhered to but for sole-workers or very small teams this technique can
							be easier to follow and therefore implement.
						</p>

						<h3>Agile method</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							By breaking large tasks into logical blocks or releases, and then subsequently
							dividing those releases into manageable and achievable short development cycles (iterations);
							the overall	efficiency and effectiveness of the whole project has been seen to improve.
							<br />
							Agile manifesto: <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">www.agilemanifesto.org</a>
							<span class="more"><a href="#">More</a></span>
						</p>
						<p>Each release is made up from a sequence of tasks that from a story; a completed set of
							multi-displined elements that when bolted together form a finish, task-focused, functioning
							content. A group of these stories when combined form a finished product that is fully functional
							and can be deployed. All of these functioning groups(releases) are then combined to form
							the finished project. No additions are added to project but are added to a <em>ToDo</em> list
							known as a backlog. These maybe urgently added to project at various release stages or maybe
							left for future versions of the project; either way the additions must not inhibit the flow
							of the iterative process. The disadvantage of this technique is the need for more multi-disciplined
							project members and the need for effective, ongoing communication on a regular basis.

						<h2>Technologies</h2>
						<p class="lead">
							Techology is always evolving and this is especially evident within the web industry. Since the
							Web's conception in the 1990s, the industry has sort to develop hardware, software and protocols
							to improve and expand the users' experience. Although there is no direct governance, several groups
							are responsible for the various standards used within these technologies for both the Internet and
							the World Wide Web. The one group that has the biggest impact on the Web and its standards is the
							World Wide Web Consortium(W3C). Under the direction of Tim Berners-Lee, the W3C are responsible for
							the content, presentation and aspect of the interactive layer of web site and their development.
							<span class="more"><a href="#">More</a></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented
							potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores,
							that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve,
							industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform.
							But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are
							creating:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CSS,</li>
							<li>SVG,</li>
							<li>WOFF,</li>
							<li>the Semantic Web stack,</li>
							<li>XML,</li>
							<li>and a variety of APIs.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Content and information</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							Providing data and information is the essential function of a web site. But making sure
							this data is in a structured and ordered format is the responsibility of the designer and
							developer. The separation of content from any other aspect of the site design or functionality
							is enssential and the developer should endeavour to ensure the site is accessible to as many
							users and their chosen devices as possible.
							<span class="more"><a href="#">More</a></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							HTML documents represent a media-independent description of interactive content. HTML
							documents might be rendered to a screen, or through a speech synthesizer, or on a
							braille display. To influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can use
							a styling language such as CSS.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Presentation and style</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							Once the content has been organised and structured, it needs to be aesthetically presented.
							Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors,
							spacing) to Web documents. To ensure that sites are accessible as possible developers should
							create a style of presentation that is consistent across pages.
							<span class="more"><a href="#">More</a></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							To minimise issues with the use of CSS developers should:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Use a minimal number of style sheets for your site,</li>
							<li>Use linked style sheets rather than embedded styles, and avoid inline style sheets.</li>
							<li>If you have more than one, use the same "class" name for the same concept in all
							of the style sheets</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

						<h3>Functionality and interaction</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							Ensuring that content and presentation give a usable experience to the end-
							user it is important that functionality is built in to the web pages. Additionally,
							the increase in popularity of web applications for both desktops and mobile devices.
							Technologies used are not all covered by the W3C's standards. Server-side scripting
							used in the majority of web applications are not part of the W3C standard but the
							output they produce in the form of HTML are. JavaScript, on the other hand, tends
							to operate on the Document Object Model which is a part of the W3C's remit.
							<span class="more"><a href="#">More</a></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							The DOM presents documents as a hierarchy of Node objects that also implement
							other, more specialized interfaces. Some types of nodes may have child nodes
							of various types, and others are leaf nodes that cannot have anything below
							them in the document structure
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Business logic and integration</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							Business logic is an essential part of all web applications. The integration of
							client-side and server-side scripting with data objects gives users a diverse
							and customised experience. Although not covered by W3C standards, as mentioned
							proviously, their output is normally formatted in HTML or XML which is. Best
							practice is driving the requirements for business logic and ensures that developers
							develop code that follows basic principles and patterns. One of the strongest growths
							in both server-side and client-side scripting is the development of frameworks and
							libraries.
							<span class="more"><a href="#">More</a></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							To simplify the implementation of content management within web sites several content
							management systems have been developed. These include: Wordpress, Drupal, ModX, Nuke,
							Magento etc. Some of these include frameworks and most adopt OOP best practices and
							frameworks.<br />
							Examples of frameworks available in PHP include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Zend Framework</li>
							<li>CodeIgniter</li>
							<li>YII</li>
							<li>Laravel</li>
							<li>Symfony</li>
							<li>CakePHP</li>
